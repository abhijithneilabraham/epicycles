    "About Epicycles\n",
    "===============\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study of ancient astronomy:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ... the epicycle is made to move in longitude in the order of the signs in a circle concentric with the Zodiac [i.e., from west to east], while the planet moves on the epicycle at a velocity which is the same as that of the anomaly; on that part of the epicycle farthest from the earth the motion is direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let us represent a motion in points with complex numbers. For example, $(x, y)$ correspond to $x+iy$, where $i$ is $\\sqrt{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remeber the addition of two complex numbers in a complex plane is similar to the addition two 2-dimension vectors, i.e. $$z = z_1 + z_2 $$ has a similar effect to $$\\vec r = \\vec{r_1} + \\vec{r_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Besides, a circular motion can be represented by $$\\vec r = (r \\cos (\\frac{2\\pi t}{P}+\\varphi), \\, r \\sin (\\frac{2\\pi t}{P}+\\varphi)) $$ where $r$ is radius, $P$ is period, and $\\varphi$ is the phase angle.\n",
    "\n",
    " And the combination of several epicycle movement could be shown as $$\\vec r = \\vec{r_1} + \\vec{r_2} + \\ldots + \\vec{r_N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Or, more briefly, as $e^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x$(where $e=2.718281\\ldots$ is the base of natual logrithm), let us write $$z=r e^{i (\\frac{2\\pi t}{P} + \\varphi)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Now, we can describe a series of epicycles as $$s_N(t) = r_1 e^{i (\\frac{2\\pi \\omega_1 t}{P} + \\varphi_1)} + r_2 e^{i (\\frac{2\\pi \\omega_2 t}{P} + \\varphi_2)} + \\ldots + r_N e^{i (\\frac{2\\pi \\omega_N t}{P} + \\varphi_N)}  = \\sum_{n=0}^N r_n e^{i (\\frac{2\\pi \\omega_n t}{P} + \\varphi_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider the motion given by a $\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ function $f(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    " As Norwood Russel Hanson pointed out in his essay *The Mathematical Power of Epicycle Astronomy*, the distance between corresponding two orbits can be less than any positive number $\\epsilon$. Thus, we can use the epicycles to represent any plane motion.\n",
    "\n",
    " Remember the *Fourier Series* given by the following equation: $$c_n = \\frac{1}{P}\\int_0^P f(t) \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi n t}{P}} \\ud t$$\n",
    "\n",
    " The inversed transform is defined as follows:$$s_N(t) = \\sum_{n=-N}^N c_n \\cdot e^{i \\frac{2\\pi n t}{P}} $$which is already quite similar to the above equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  What's more, $r e^{i (\\frac{2\\pi n t}{P}+\\varphi)}$ equals to $c e^{i \\frac{2 \\pi n t}{P}}$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $c = r\\cos\\varphi + i r\\sin\\varphi$. To calculate the real number $r$ and $\\varphi$, we have $r = |c|$ and $\\varphi = \\mathrm{atan2}(\\mathfrak{Im}\\{c\\},\\, \\mathfrak{Re}\\{c\\})$\n",
    "\n",
    " In this way, we can explain any periodic plane motion by the epicycle-on-deferent theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The above method is mathematically correct, however, when computing using a computer, the accurate computation with a huge amout of integral is not efficient. It is neither unrealistic to calculate an arbitrary motion originally on a piece of paper. Therefore, we need another approach to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " Remember the *Discrete Fourier Transeform*, which is defined as$$y_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi k n}{N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " This can be done in a really fast speed using *Fast Fourier Transform(fft)*, an algorithm within the time limit of $\\Theta(n \\log_2 n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    " To convert the integration part into a *fft* calculation, let us write $$c_n = \\frac{1}{P}\\int_0^P f(t) \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi n t}{P}} \\ud t = \\frac{1}{P} \\cdot \\frac{P}{N} \\cdot \\lim_{N \\to +\\infty}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} f(\\frac{k P}{N}) \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi n}{P} \\cdot \\frac{k P}{N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " Shall we choose a large number $N$. In order to satisfy the algorithm of *fft*, we may choose some of these powers of 2(e.g. 1024), and $f(\\frac{k P}{N})$ could be a pre-prepared complex-varible sample array $\\{a_1, \\, a_2, \\, \\ldots, \\, a_k\\}$. Now, we have $$c_n = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} a_k \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi k n}{N}}$$ which exactly matches the formula of the *Discrete Fourier Transform*.\n",
    "\n",
    " While the *Inversed Discrete Fourier Transform* defined as$$x_n = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} y_k \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi k n}{N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " It is not difficult to relate this equation to the movement of epicycles:$$s_N(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_n \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi n}{N} \\cdot \\frac{N t}{P}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} c_n \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi n t}{P}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The above method is also mathematically correct. However, some coefficients with large modules are likely to appear at the end of the *fft* output array. In this way, although all sample points are passed by the last epicycle, the $s_N(t)$ curve cannot match the original motion. But there is a simple solution.\n",
    "\n",
    " From the *Discrete Fourier Transform* equation we find that the iterater $n$ values from $0$ to $N$, which is not necessary. Since $e^{\\frac{2\\pi k}{N}} = e^{\\frac{2\\pi k}{N}} / e^{\\frac{2\\pi N}{N}} = e^{\\frac{2\\pi (N-k)}{N}}$, the frequency of epicycles can be reduced. Thus we have $$s_N'(t)=\\sum_{n=-N'}^{N'-1} c'_n \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi n t}{P}}$$ where $N'=N/2$, $c'_n = c_n \\textrm{ for } n \\geq 0$, and $c'_n = c_{n+N} \\textrm{ for } n < 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Althouh our conclusions are based on a plane periodic motion, it should be pointed out that any motion -perodic or not, closed or open- can be represented by infinite epicycles. Besides, according to Norwood Hanson's essay, with the improvements of graphical techniques, it is possible to represent epicycles in a more complicated way, beyond the limits of the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is a program written in python which I made to convey the elegance of epicycle astronomy. It is available here: <https://github.com/sclereid/epicycles>\n",
